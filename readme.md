# Galaxy spin and environment
This repo contains code to understand how a galaxy spin depends on properties such as stellar mass, halo mass, group membership, and, large-scale environment. 
Data is taken from the [MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/) galaxy survey and combined with [group catalogues](https://gax.sjtu.edu.cn/data/Group.html), and, [cosmic web catalogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02676). 

A galaxy's spin appears to be driven by stellar mass, however, shows secondary dependences on cluster-centric distance and even filementary structure. This is detail in my Thesis (to be published soon), and, best summaried in ./scripts/random_forest.
