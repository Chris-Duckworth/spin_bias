# Galaxy spin and environment
This repo contains code to understand how a galaxy spin depends on properties such as stellar mass, halo mass, group membership, and, large-scale environment. 

A galaxy's spin appears to be driven by stellar mass, however, shows secondary dependences on cluster-centric distance and even filamentary structure. This is detailed in chapter 4 of my [thesis](https://github.com/Chris-Duckworth/Thesis), and, best quickly summaried in ./scripts/random_forest. 

## Data 
Data is taken from various sources and a basic summary of each catalogue is given here, however, for more detail see [here](https://github.com/Chris-Duckworth/Thesis) and the references therein.

Integral field unit observations are from the [MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/) galaxy survey, which is processed by the internal Data Analysis Pipeline [DAP](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/manga-analysis-pipeline/). This is used to compute Î»<sub>R</sub>, a flux weighted measure of coherent rotation of a galaxy [see here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.379..401E/abstract). 

Additional information is taken from the [NASA-Sloan Atlas](https://www.sdss.org/dr13/manga/manga-target-selection/nsa/) targetting catalogue which provides stellar mass, and, galaxy inclination. For all galaxies in MaNGA, morphological classifications from citizen science project [galaxyZoo](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/data_access/value-added-catalogs/?vac_id=manga-morphologies-from-galaxy-zoo) are found. 

These catalogues are cross-matched with [group catalogues](https://gax.sjtu.edu.cn/data/Group.html) found from galaxies in the SDSS-DR7 spectroscopic sample, which provides halo mass, and, central/satellite definition.

[Cosmic web catalogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02676) are also cross-matched to this data to provide distances to morphological features of the cosmic web such as distances to filaments and nodes. 

### Catalog class object
Data catalogues (and various versions of MaNGA data releases) are brought together the catalog class object found [here](./lib/catalog.py)
